## Overview of the Event

The Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, officially known as **Paris 2024**, unfolded in the 'City of Lights' from July 26 to August 11, 2024.

### Javelin Throw: The Neeraj Chopra Saga
All eyes were on defending Olympic champion **Neeraj Chopra** in the Men's Javelin Throw final at the **Stade de France**. While the contest was fierce, Chopraâ€™s impressive second-best career throw of **89.45m** was ultimately pipped by Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem, who set a new Olympic Record of 92.97m. Chopraâ€™s silver medal was a testament to his sustained excellence, confirming his status as the most successful individual Olympic medallist from India.

### Shooting: A Historic Haul
The Indian shooting contingent, with **21 athletes**, was a standout success.
#### Manu Bhaker's Double Bronze
The performance of **Manu Bhaker** was historic. In the Womenâ€™s **10m Air Pistol** final, she displayed remarkable composure to secure the **Bronze Medal** with a final score of **210.2**, overcoming the intense pressure of her Olympic debut from the previous Games. She quickly backed this up by pairing with **Sarabjot Singh** in the **Mixed Team 10m Air Pistol**, where they won a nail-biting bronze medal match against South Korea, ending a long wait for Indiaâ€™s first-ever Olympic team medal in the sport.

#### Swapnil Kusaleâ€™s Breakthrough
A third shooting medal came from **Swapnil Kusale** in the Menâ€™s **50m Rifle 3 Positions**. Kusale's bronze was particularly significant, marking India's first-ever Olympic medal in this highly technical discipline, underlining the depth in the **Indian shooting** setup.

### Men's Hockey: Bronze Defended
The **Indian Men's Hockey Team**, led by captain **Harmanpreet Singh**, navigated a challenging group stage that included a historic **3-2** win against Australiaâ€”their first Olympic victory against the Kookaburras since 1972. Although they fell to Germany in the semi-finals, the team demonstrated great character to beat Spain **2-1** in the bronze medal playoff, with goals from **Hardik Singh** and **Harmanpreet Singh**. This achievement secured **back-to-back Olympic medals** for the team after a 52-year gap, reaffirming their return to the elite of world **field hockey**.

### Near Misses and Heartbreak
India also suffered six fourth-place finishes, a bitter pill to swallow. Notable near-misses included **Lakshya Sen** in Badminton Menâ€™s Singles, who lost his bronze medal match, and the mixed team in archery and shooting events. Tokyo silver medallist **Mirabai Chanu** also narrowly missed the podium in Weightlifting.

The **Paris Olympics 2024** proved to be a pivotal stepping stone for the **Indian team**. The total of **6 medals**â€”India's third-best haul everâ€”confirms that the country's transformation into a multi-sport powerhouse is well underway. The exceptional performance in **shooting** with three medals, combined with the sustained success in **athletics**, **hockey**, and **wrestling**, showcases a broader base of excellence than ever before.

The experience gained by the young contingent, particularly the pain of the six fourth-place finishes, will be a crucial lesson. It signifies the need to convert potential into definitive resultsâ€”a matter of fine-tuning mental game, physical peak, and technical precision in the crucial final moments.

Looking ahead to **Los Angeles 2028**, the foundation is strong. The rise of young talents like **Aman Sehrawat** and the enduring excellence of stars like **Neeraj Chopra** promise a bright future. The **Indian performance** at **Paris 2024** was not merely a finish line, but a launchpad for **LA 2028**, where the country will undoubtedly aim to break into the double-digit medal tally and claim its elusive first post-Tokyo gold medal.
