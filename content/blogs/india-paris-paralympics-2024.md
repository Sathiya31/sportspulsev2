The **Indian Team performance** delivered a staggering **record-breaking haul of 29 medals**‚Äîcomprising **7 Gold**, 9 Silver, and 13 Bronze‚Äîcatapulting the nation to an impressive **18th position** in the overall medal table. This **Key Result** not only shattered the previous best of 19 medals from Tokyo 2020 but also cemented India's status as a rapidly rising force on the global stage.

## ü•á Overall Performance: Detailed Summary and Strategic Success

The collective success of the **Indian Team** was a testament to targeted funding, enhanced coaching, and an unprecedented level of grassroots development.

### Highlights and Defining Moments

* **Record-Shattering Tally:** The **Indian Team** finished with **29 medals**, officially crossing the 50-medal milestone in total Paralympic history.
* **Javelin Dominance:** **Sumit Antil** successfully executed a **championship defense**, claiming Gold and setting a new **Paralympic Record** in the Men's Javelin Throw F64.

* **Largest Contingent:** The **Indian Team** sent a record 84 athletes, competing in 12 sports, demonstrating expanded breadth and depth of talent.

### Sectoral **Tactical Breakdown**

The **29 medals** were distributed across five sports, a key indicator of a healthy sporting ecosystem:

| Sport | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Athletics** (Track & Field) | 4 | 6 | 7 | **17** |
| Badminton | 1 | 2 | 2 | **5** |
| Shooting Para Sport | 1 | 1 | 2 | **4** |
| Archery | 1 | 0 | 1 | **2** |
| Judo | 0 | 0 | 1 | **1** |

The reliance on **Athletics** (17 medals) as the primary medal driver was consistent with pre-Games strategy, but the surprise contributions from Archery and the stability of Shooting and Badminton were critical in achieving the **Key Result**. The single bronze in Blind Judo marked a successful debut in a new discipline.

## ü•ä Performance of Key Athletes and Teams

The historic **Indian Team performance** was built upon numerous moments of individual brilliance, where athletes converted strong **Paralympic qualifying** form into medal-winning reality at the **Paris 2024 Paralympics**.

### Sumit Antil: The New Benchmark in Javelin
**Sumit Antil** delivered arguably the most dominant display by any Indian athlete at the Games. His Gold in the Men's Javelin Throw F64 was a masterclass in precision and power. The **Crucial Statistic/Record** defining his victory was the new **Paralympic Record** of **70.59m**. Remarkably, **Antil** broke the previous record three times during the final, demonstrating extraordinary consistency and a focused **championship defense** of his Tokyo 2020 title. His throw stood 2.04m clear of his closest rival, showcasing an elite physical and technical edge.

### Avani Lekhara: Doubling Down on Gold
**Avani Lekhara** confirmed her status as a global icon by winning Gold in the Women's R2 10m Air Rifle Standing SH1. Her ability to handle the pressure of defending an Olympic/Paralympic title‚Äîoften cited as the hardest achievement in sport‚Äîunderscores her immense mental strength. This second Paralympic Gold makes her the first Indian woman to secure two top-podium finishes, cementing a significant legacy.

### Para Athletics: The Engine Room of the **Indian Team**
Beyond **Antil**, the Athletics squad saw multiple records and breakthrough moments:
* **Praveen Kumar** secured Gold in the Men‚Äôs High Jump T64 with an Asian Record jump of 2.08m, upgrading his silver from Tokyo.
* **Dharambir** clinched Gold in the Men's Club Throw F51, leading an **Indian** one-two finish alongside Silver medallist **Parnav Soorma**.
* **Mariyappan Thangavelu**, the veteran high jumper, secured Bronze (T63), making him the first Indian to win medals at three consecutive Paralympic Games (Rio 2016 Gold, Tokyo 2020 Silver, Paris 2024 Bronze). This feat showcases unparalleled sustained excellence.

### Archery and Badminton: Expanding Horizons
* **Harvinder Singh** achieved a historic milestone, securing **India‚Äôs first-ever Paralympic Archery Gold** in the Men's Individual Recurve Open.
* The Archery Mixed Team Compound, featuring 17-year-old sensation **Sheetal Devi** (who shoots using her feet), secured a Bronze. **Devi** became **India's** youngest Paralympic medallist, showcasing the potential for future dominance.
* The Badminton team added five medals, including a Gold from **Kumar Nitesh** (Men‚Äôs Singles SL3) and Silver from **Suhas Yathiraj** (Men‚Äôs Singles SL4), demonstrating depth in a growing sport.

## üß† Conclusion: Analysis of Results and Future Outlook

The **Key Result** of **29 medals** at the **Paris 2024 Paralympics** is not the final destination, but a powerful indicator of India's rapid upward trajectory in para-sports. The success is rooted in three key analytical pillars:

1.  **Systematic Investment:** The increased size of the contingent (84 athletes) and the diversification into new sports (Judo, Para Cycling) directly reflects the positive impact of government support schemes like TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) and Khelo India. This investment is successfully translating into podium finishes.
2.  **Mental and Technical Supremacy:** The success in **championship defense** (Antil, Lekhara) and the breaking of global records highlight the superior technical preparation and mental conditioning now prevalent in the **Indian Team**. **Antil's** repeated breaking of the **Paralympic Record** with his **70.59m** throw exemplifies this relentless pursuit of excellence.
3.  **Broadening the Medal Base:** The spread of medals across multiple disciplines is the most encouraging sign for long-term sustainability. This de-risks the overall medal tally from poor performance in a single sport and indicates a robust structure for **Paralympic qualifying** success in upcoming cycles.

The **Indian Team performance** in **Paris 2024 Paralympics** has fundamentally shifted global expectations. The legacy of these **29 medals** will be a heightened national focus on disability sports. The goal for the next cycle, culminating in LA 2028, will be to consolidate the dominance in Athletics and Shooting while aiming for multiple Golds in emerging sports like Archery and Badminton. The message to the world is clear: *India is ready to be a top-tier Paralympic nation.*
