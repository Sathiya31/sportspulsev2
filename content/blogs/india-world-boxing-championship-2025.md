* **Pooja Rani**, the seasoned Olympian, secured a Bronze medal in the Womenâ€™s 80kg category. Despite falling in the semi-final to local favourite Emily Asquith, her consistent presence on the podium provides invaluable stability and experience to the team.

### Setbacks for the Elite
While the medal haul was historic, the early exits of established stars like two-time world champion **Nikhat Zareen** (51kg quarter-final loss to two-time Olympic silver medallist Buse Naz Ã‡akÄ±roÄŸlu of TÃ¼rkiye) and Olympic medallist **Lovlina Borgohain** (75kg second-round exit) highlight the brutal competitiveness and generational change occurring in the sport.
